#Todo-Management-System:

a) To Execute Backend code of the project, please follow these steps:
To execute the backend part of this application, we need to use the Spring Boot Framework project.
The Spring Boot Framework is an open-source Java-based framework used for creating stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications.
The application can be imported into the Spring Tool Suite IDE, which is an Eclipse-based IDE, for execution.
To store the data, you will need to connect to a database. So create a database in MySql and make sure that the same database name is provided in application.properties of the Spring Project.
Once imported, we can run the application using the embedded Tomcat server that comes with the Spring Boot Framework.
This allows us to deploy and execute the application without the need for an external server.
We can also use various tools such as Postman to test the application's RESTful web services and ensure that they are functioning as expected.

b) To Execute the Frontend code of the project, please follow these steps:
Import the project to VS Code.
Open the terminal and navigate into the capestone project folder.
Install axios for handling HTTP Requests using the command "npm install axios".
Install React Router and React Router DOM for client-side routing using the command "npm install react-router react-router-dom".
Also add the node_modules folder which is essential for running the application.
Run the application using the command "npm start".
After running the command, the web page will be opened automatically.
